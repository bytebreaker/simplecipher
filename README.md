============

About
-----
Toy code for encrypting and decrypting the classic Caesar Cipher (single alphabet substitution cipher) .

Explanation of the Caesar Cipher http://goo.gl/23MVS

Reference code used by simple cipher adopted from Al Sweigart http://goo.gl/Of5DSb

Features
--------
* Insanely fast encoding speed.
* Sadly, pretty easy to break.
* Can be a useful proof of concept to understand basic substitution as a cryptographic method.
* Free and open source.

Example usage:
--------------
Just run the script on the command line.  If there a file named 'encrypted_text.txt'

in the same directory as the script, it will try to convert it back to plain text.

Example:  >> python cipher.py
